# SpaceGamePrelim

The first, basic components that will be incorporated into a fully working game later in the future.

The goal of this project is to create a set of tools on top of the Simple DirectMedia Layer Graphics Library to allow much simpler creation of games. This will be accomplished by creating a basic game framework forming the backbone of this project. This framework is concerned with the lower level aspects of this game, including, the game cycle, texture management, memory, etc. 

In addition to this framework, a map system will also be added. The goal for this map system is to devise an algorithm that can generate both rooms and maps randomly based on a definition. These maps will also be procedural, and have the ability to be endless.
